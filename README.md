## Installing in Python

The twilio-python helper library lets you write Python code to make HTTP requests to the Twilio API.

### Installation

The easiest way to install twilio-python is from PyPi using pip, a package manager for Python. Simply run this in the terminal:

#### pip install twilio

If you get a pip: command not found error, you can also use easy_install. Run this in your terminal:

#### easy_install twilio

Or, you can download the source code (ZIP) for twilio-python, and then install the library by running:

#### python setup.py install

in the folder containing the twilio-python library.

#### "Permission Denied"

If the command line gives you a big long error message that says Permission Denied in the middle of it, try running the above commands with sudo, ex. sudo pip install twilio.
